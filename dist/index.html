        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          To be in constant chase of fleeting dreams. Everyday, I ask myself,
          who was I yesterday how different am I today , how far have I managed
          to come along , is this much progress enough! Are you happy with this.
          Consistency is key! To push myself forward that is the motto I live
          by😌 The sky is the limit. I love adding new skills regularly to my
          skill set,all the while leveling up on the existing ones. My skill
          hunting has taken me to multiple unrelated streams\n app development
          using Flutter and ReactNative frameworks, designing prototypes(in
          Figma and AdobeXd), video-editing,designing,content creation(making
          AMV's),I have just started off with webdevelopment too XD
        </p>

        <p>
          To quit at minor setbacks!! The one thing I absolutely dispise is the
          act of giving up. I don't always do things alone.At the time of
          setbacks I make it a point to depend on others around me,I ask
          reliable people on their opinions and for strategies.To take
          inspiration from them,to learn from them,to grow with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          To network with new people!\nThere goes a saying that network is
          net-Worth. I absolutely believe that people should meet new people who
          shares our motives and Ideologies constantly.In doing so we can
          ultimately light up our competitive spirts.In the end it all comes
          down to GROWTH. Take up responsibilites and grow together with peers.

        <h2>🌮 Work History</h2>

        <h3>St Antony's Public School</h3>
        <p>
          This is the school where i completed my 11th and 12th, it was a
          different experience altogether a bording school with unbelivably
          strict hostel were mobile and laptops where not permitted. So it did
          not really play much of a part in my career growth but as for
          character growth,the hostel was under a seminary......you can guess
          the rest.But the one thing I gained here was connections. My life and
          routines were affected considerably by the people who lived with me
          there and they still continue to inspire and help me grow.
        </p>
        <h3>Saintgits College of Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently pursuing my bachellor's degree here. The opportunities
          to grow and learn are available in pleanty in this institution.The
          staff and faculty and even the people who live around there are
          supportive to our cause.I can focus on building connections and
          gathering the will to do more each day at the campus(well outside the
          classrooms off course!) A degree is all but a name head, there is more
          to a college life than classrooms!😌
        </p>
        <h3>TATOS Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          The one place that has tables around for me ^0^ . The peers here are
          all skill focused induviduals and here is where I have learned the
          most from. My mentor here is go-to-go person for advise both in life
          and work. He constantly backs me up and motives me to be my best. The
          peers here are also very helpful and ready to lend a hand no matter
          the hour of the day! Blessed to be a part of this community\n ♥️
          THANKYOU TATOS ♥️
